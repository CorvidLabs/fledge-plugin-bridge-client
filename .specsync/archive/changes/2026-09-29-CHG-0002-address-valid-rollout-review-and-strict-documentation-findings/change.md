# Address valid rollout review and strict documentation findings

## Intent

Address valid rollout review and strict documentation findings

## Affected Canonical Specs

- None

## Acceptance Criteria

- Generated guidance and lifecycle path coverage are structurally correct
- review findings are addressed
- and Bridge client ShellCheck and smoke verification remain green.

## No-spec Rationale

Generated agent commands, section labels, command names, and lifecycle path coverage are corrected without changing Bridge client behavior.

## Migration Note

Migrated by hand to SpecSync 6 per Leif's decision (2026-09-28); the 6.0.0 tool refused to archive this legacy record (`` archive target historical-integrity preflight failed: legacy accepted change `CHG-0002-address-valid-rollout-review-and-strict-documentation-findings` requires exactly one distinct valid historical reconstruction, found 0; first reconstruction failure: legacy accepted change `CHG-0002-address-valid-rollout-review-and-strict-documentation-findings` cannot reproduce its signed raw-content aggregate ``).

- Workflow v1 (SpecSync 5) record, accepted on 2026-07-13 by the closing approval already stored in `approvals.json`. `specsync change audit` passes it, but the archive preflight can't authenticate its accepted evidence, for the reason quoted above.
- Moved by hand from `.specsync/changes/CHG-0002-address-valid-rollout-review-and-strict-documentation-findings/` into the layout `specsync change archive` writes: `accepted-state.json` is the unchanged accepted `state.json`, `state.json` is marked `archived`, and this file's front matter says `archived`.
- `approvals.json`, `verification.json` and every other artifact are the original SpecSync 5 evidence, unchanged. `verification.json` verifies commit `b3188af3531755550e9fce0e5458c57cbdb55f0d`, not the tree this record was archived from.
- There is no `verification-attempts.json`: SpecSync 5 did not write one for this record, and this migration does not invent attempt history.
- This migration added no verification evidence, test result, attempt history, or approval. It is a manual migration, not a fresh re-verification.
- `specsync change archive` refused it for the reason quoted above. Per Leif's decision it was archived by hand instead, so no reopen or new approval is recorded.
